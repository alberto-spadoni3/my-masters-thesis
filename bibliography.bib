  abstract = {A key function in any information security infrastructure is represented by access control which concerns the ways according to which users can access resources in a computer systems. Access control is one of the most pervasive security mechanisms in use today and is present in almost all systems, from operating systems to database management systems. Access control is usually based on access permits, also called authorizations, specifying which subjects can access which objects for performing which actions. Access control, however, imposes great administrative and architectural challenges and also requires careful design. In particular, a relevant problem, especially when dealing with large systems, is represented by the complexity of access control administration. Access control administration deals with assigning and revoking authorizations.}
